ARO 10 was an off-road vehicle produced by ARO and manufactured in Romania. The ARO 24 Series got a "little brother" in 1980, the ARO 10 Series. While the ARO-24 can be classified as mid-size SUVs, the ARO 10 is about the size of a Jeep Wrangler. It was produced in many body trims, equipped with seven different engines (both gas and Diesel), and came in both 4x2 and 4x4 versions.[1] The ARO 10 was sold as the Dacia Duster in some international markets and as ACM Enduro x4 in Italy (assembled by ARO-Ciemme).[1] A model derived from ARO 10, named ARO Spartana, was also produced starting 1997. The last evolution of ARO 10, produced from 1999, was called ARO 10 Super, had a slight design revamp and was built on ARO 24 Series chassis.[2]
